Last night at approximately 0230 hours the local Gendarmerie headquarters on Malden recieved an anonymous call claiming to be from an FIA representative. A known and up to date FIA callsign was provided 
to authenticate the call. The caller claimed that today the FIA was going to perform a series of strikes on community representative officers across Malden. No time frame was provided by the caller but 
around one hour ago, known FIA associates were tracked taking a number of calls in short succession. The expectation is that the attacks are imminent and underway.
<br/><br/>
To that end, the local Gendarmerie units have been mobilised. Suspected targets for the FIA attacks have been marked on the area map, and teams will work in units of two with Dispatch and Unit Command 
operating from an aerial unit.
<br/><br/>
ENEMY FORCES
<br/>
The FIA cell on Malden is small, but better armed than the Gendarmerie units on the Island, thanks to their acquisition of ex-AAF military surplus when they defected during the Civil War. They will 
likely be driving civilian vehicles to mask with the local population.
<br/><br/>
FRIENDLY FORCES
<br/>
Gendarmerie Units are lightly armed but highly mobile. Unit Command will operate from a Helicopter Unit to provide aerial recon of the Island.
<br/><br/>
ADMINISTRATION
<br/>
Blufor Units may move out when Safestart has ONE minute left on it's timer. This does NOT apply to the Helicopter, which must remain grounded and engines off until Safestart has ended. FIA units may also 
move out with ONE minute left on the Safestart timer but are expected to do so in an effort to blend with the civilians, not ramn the nearest target as soon as Safestart has officially ended.
